# 🚂 Railway Deployment Fix

The Railway deployment was failing due to Nix configuration issues. Here's the fix:

## ❌ **Problem**
```
error: undefined variable 'pip'
```

## ✅ **Solution**

I've updated the configuration to use Docker instead of Nixpacks, which is more reliable for Python applications.

### **Files Updated:**

1. **`railway.json`** - Changed from NIXPACKS to DOCKERFILE
2. **`Dockerfile`** - Added proper Python setup
3. **`requirements.txt`** - Removed yt-dlp (problematic in serverless)
4. **`scripts/instagram_downloader_railway.py`** - Railway-optimized Python script

## 🚀 **Deploy Again**

### **Method 1: Railway Dashboard**
1. **Push the updated code**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment - use Docker instead of Nixpacks"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Redeploy in Railway**:
   - Go to your Railway project
   - Click "Redeploy" or it will auto-deploy

### **Method 2: Railway CLI**
```bash
# If you have Railway CLI installed
railway up
```

## 🔧 **What Changed**

### **Before (Nixpacks - Failed)**
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["python3", "pip"]
```

### **After (Docker - Works)**
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
```

## 🐍 **Python Scripts**

The app now uses **3 Python scripts** with smart fallback:

1. **`instagram_downloader_railway.py`** - Railway-optimized (primary)
2. **`instagram_downloader_simple.py`** - Lightweight fallback
3. **`instagram_downloader.py`** - Advanced (with yt-dlp) - may not work in Railway

## ✅ **Expected Result**

Your Railway deployment should now:
- ✅ Build successfully with Docker
- ✅ Install Python dependencies correctly
- ✅ Run the Next.js application
- ✅ Execute Python scripts for Instagram extraction

## 🔍 **If Still Failing**

### **Check Railway Logs**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Check "Deployments" tab
4. Look for build logs

### **Common Issues**
- **Python not found**: Check if `python3` is available
- **Dependencies missing**: Verify `requirements.txt` is correct
- **Script errors**: Check Python script execution

### **Debug Commands**
```bash
# Test locally first
python scripts/instagram_downloader_railway.py "https://www.instagram.com/p/example"

# Check if all files are committed
git status
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Redeploy** with the updated configuration
2. **Test** with a real Instagram URL
3. **Check logs** for any remaining issues
4. **Configure AdSense** credentials

The Docker-based approach should resolve the Nix configuration issues! 🚀
